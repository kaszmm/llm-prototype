Qapita was started by Ravi, Lakshman and Vamsee, a Banker-Investor-Technologist trio, who have known each other for a couple of decades and have followed each other’s journeys becoming good friends. Each of them comes with over 2 decades of experience in investing in startups and building products at scale.
Thus, having lived through the challenges in the private markets and with a deep understanding of how the sector operates, Ravi, Lakshman and Vamsee came together to setup Qapita and found themselves a mission to spend the second half of their careers.
Qapita seeks to build rails for the private markets by offering companies a platform of record for managing ownership, an efficient equity workflow management and a structured marketplace to offer liquidity to stakeholders. Qapita’s purpose is to make every equity owner count.
Qapita is an equity management platform with offices in Singapore, India, and Indonesia. We partner with progressive enterprises to help them seed, build, harness and eventually Unlock the Power of Ownership for their stakeholders.
Our economy and its future is defined by innovation. Fueling this innovation is human capital, which has become far more powerful as ownership gets democratised and professionals become owners; as founders, as investors and also as employees. Ownership is important. Ownership creates alignment. It also drives compounding, exponential returns. There's no true equity without equity. 
Our software solution streamlines the equity management process around Cap Tables, ESOPs, and transactions; Qapita Marketplace facilitates liquidity to ESOP holders and shareholders via structured buyback programs and secondary transactions.
We are founded by three experienced cofounders, each with over twenty years of track record in investment banking, corporate venture capital and technology sectors; and backed by East Ventures, Vulcan Capital, Nyca Partners, MassMutual Ventures, Endiya Partners, Citi, Alto Partners, and numerous marquee angel investors.
