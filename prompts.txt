    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "A grant, in the context of equity awards, 
    typically refers to the issuance of stock options or shares to employees or other stakeholders in a company.
    These grants represent a form of compensation or incentive, giving the recipient an ownership stake or potential future ownership in the company."

  { 
    "role": "user", "content": "What is a option award or stock options?" },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Option awards or stock options are a form of compensation given to employees, 
     which gives them the right to purchase a specific number of shares of the company's stock at a predetermined price,
      known as the exercise price, for a certain period. Once exercised this options can be converted into shares through share issuances."
  },
  { "role": "user", "content": "What do you mean by share awards? Is it any different than option awards?" },
    { 
        "role": "assistant", "content": "Share awards, unlike option awards, involve directly granting company shares to employees. 
    This means employees receive actual shares, not just the option to buy them. 
    Unlike stock options, where employees must decide to exercise their option to buy shares at a certain price, 
    share awards typically grant ownership of shares outright, often subject to a vesting schedule" 
    },
   { "role": "user", "content": "You mentioned something called vesting schedule, in what context is it related to grants?" },
      { 
        "role": "assistant", "content": "A vesting schedule, part of a vesting template in grants, 
      displays the timeline for the vesting of granted units. It's shown in a datatable, detailing vesting dates,
       quantities, percentage vested, and exercise start and end dates. This helps grantees track their equity award vesting over time."
        },
{ "role": "user", "content": "Thanks for explaining, but I was wondering to whom we can grant these options or share awards?" },
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Admins or users with the right access can grant these options to stakeholders.
  Stakeholders can exercise vested options for share issuance. In contrast, share awards involve directly granting shares to stakeholders,
   typically without the need for exercising, once the admin approves the share issuance." }

    { "role": "user", "content": "Hey i am noticing you are mentioning the stakeholder a lot, but what does a stakeholder mean? And how it is associted with the grantings?" },
    { "role": "user", "assistant": "Stakeholder generally refers to any individual or group that has an interest or stake in the company. 
    This can include employees, investors, founders, or board members. 
    Stakeholders are often the recipients of equity grants because they have a vested interest in the company's success.
     Equity grants, such as stock options or share awards, are a way to align the interests of these stakeholders with the growth and 
     performance of the company, as they get a share in the ownership or profits. 
     In essence, stakeholders are integral to the process of granting equity because they are the ones who benefit from these grants and, 
     in turn, contribute to the company's achievements." },

{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "What are the things required to create the grants?"
},
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "To create an option award grant, there are a few required things that need to be provided upfront to successfully grant an award to a stakeholder.
   The things that are required are:
    1. Stakeholder's Name : Which suggests to which stakeholder you want to grant this award,
    2. Granted Units: How many award units do you want to grant to the stakeholder? 
    3. Equity Award Pool or Pool: From which pool do you want to grant the units? 
    4. Grant Date: On which date do you want to grant the award, where generally a future or past date is allowed, 
    5. Exercise Price: Once the granted units are vested, at what price can the vested units be exercised for getting the share issuance? The stakeholder will be paying the amount based on the exercise price, 
    6. Vesting Schedule: Provides a detailed timeline of units that are going to be vested; these are pre-generated and can be selected from provided templates, 
    7. Exercise Period Template: This provides the bounds of the exercise start and end date. The stakeholder can start exercising on or after the start date, and any unexercised units will lapse after the end date, 
    8. Vesting Start Date: This represents the day from which the vesting of granted units will start; it can be before, on, or after the grant date. 
    
    There are other fields also which can be given while granting an award."

  "content": "I noticed you said an Equity Award Pool is required, but what does it mean?"
},
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": "Sure, that's a great observation. 
  An Equity Award Pool, often referred to as an equity pool or stock pool, 
  is a portion of a company's shares set aside for equity compensation.
   This pool is used to grant stock options, restricted stock, or other equity awards to employees, executives,
    and sometimes advisors or consultants. The pool size represents a percentage of the company's total equity, 
    aimed at incentivizing and rewarding those who contribute to the company's growth and success. 
    One key thing to remember is that granted units can never exceed the Total Available Pool size."

  Steps to follow:
  1. you'll find a left panel for navigation. In this panel, there's an expandable dropdown named 'Equity Awards.' 
  2. Clicking on it reveals several options. The first one is 'Pools,' the second is 'Plans,' and the third is 'Grants.' 
  3. Click on 'Grants' to view a grid of granted option awards. 
  4. At the top right, there's a 'Grant Awards' dropdown where you select 'Option Award,' 'Share Awards,' or 'SAR Awards.' 
  5. Selecting any of these options brings up a grant modal popup, where you need to fill in the 8 required fields I previously mentioned."
